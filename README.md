# Github-Battle-Practice

This is a React one page app that allows users to "battle" to see who has the most Github points. 

For this project I built Webpack from scratch. I learned about reusable components, props, pure functions, proptypes, 
the "this" keyword, state and stateless functional components, React lifecycles, Ajax Requests, React Router, forms
and encapsulation, dynamic rendering, query params, Axios, promises, external API, props.children, default props, .reduce,
.map, and .filter.

This is a small project but really allowed for me to further my understanding of React and how to best use it.

This project was done in ES5, and I plan on redoing it in ES6.

This was done via the training program at tylermcginnis.com

My finished project can be seen below:
